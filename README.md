Recreation of Conway's Game of Life in C.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

Specs:
The map is a 16 * 25 rectangle. The user can either input his own map via a properly formatted text file, ask for the program to generate a random 50-char seed, or input his own 50-char seed (seed must consist of ASCII values between 33 and 96). For a given seed, every playthrough will be exactly similar, thus you can keep and rewatch playthroughs you liked.

Currently, the map starts with approximately 3/16 population (~19%), although the ability to tweak population ratio will probabaly be added in the future.
